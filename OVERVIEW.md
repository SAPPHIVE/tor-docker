⚠️ **UNOFFICIAL IMAGE**

## 🚀 Overview

This image provides a production-hardened, automatically updated Tor client. It is designed for developers and DevOps teams who need a reliable, up-to-date Tor SOCKS5 proxy without the maintenance overhead.

### Key Features:
*   🛡️ **Security Hardened:** Runs as a non-root user (`debian-tor`).
*   🔄 **Fully Automated:** Rebuilt weekly to ensure the latest Tor binary and OS security patches.
*   🩺 **Integrated Healthchecks:** Periodic internal checks verify the SOCKS5 proxy is active.
*   📦 **Multi-Arch Support:** Optimized for `amd64` (Intel/AMD) and `arm64` (Apple Silicon/Raspberry Pi).
